Hello! I am Cobi Panti and I am studying Computer Science and I'm interested in developing video games in the future but right now I would want to make a COVID-19 tracker.
The tracker would mainly contain different helpful graphs such as people infected, treated, and died.
It will more importantly make far more important graphs such as:
rate of infections, treated, and deaths
infections per tests
infections per population
deaths per population

Entities will be the data-sets, graphs, and news articles.
